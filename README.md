# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a classic two-player game implemented as a web application. This simple project helps beginners practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a functional and interactive game where players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid to achieve a winning line of three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

Features:

* Two-Player Gameplay: Players alternate turns, placing 'X' or 'O' in the cells of the grid.
* Win Detection: Automatically detects and announces the winner when a player achieves three in a row.
* Draw Detection: Recognizes and announces a draw when all cells are filled without a winner.
* Game Reset: Allows players to start a new game with a reset button.

Project Structure:

* HTML: Sets up the structure of the game board and includes controls for resetting the game.
* CSS: Styles the game board and cells, making it visually appealing and easy to use.
* JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including handling player moves, checking for winners, and updating the game status.
